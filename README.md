# Clustering 
Implementation of the **Expectation Maximization** based k-means clustering algorithm applied to the data set provided (*pr3.data*) for k ∈ {2, 3, 4}. 
The program connsideres various values for σ, including σ ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 2.0}, and runs the clustering multiple times for each σ value under different initial conditions and outputting the results.
It then evaluates the quality of the clustering for each value of σ using an average of the Davies-Bouldin Index for each clustering.
